## Middleware

The FNX middleware API allows you to intercept actions. It allows you to run code both before and
after the action has executed and gives you some useful information about what's happening along the
way. Middleware could be used to implement logging, graceful failures, diff history recording, and
much more. Read about the specifics of how to use middleware [here](/docs/api/use.md).
